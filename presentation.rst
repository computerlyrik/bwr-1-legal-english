* Transcript on page 282

  - Two sequential steps - due diligence and deal stage

Step 1 : Due diligence
=======================

* uncovering all liabilities
* checking rightness of the claims made by the seller
* listing key assets
* getting details of legal cases
* check contractual obligations

.. note::
  - means: scrunity of liabilities and assets
  - key assets are: property, equipment, intellectual property, copyright and patents
  - pending cases from the past, current or pending
  - contractual obligations - between the business and employees, customers and suppliers
  - also watch out for future obligations

Step 2: Deal stage
==================

* get confirmations and commitments from the seller
* get a warranty
* get a commitment from the seller to reimburse you in certain situations

.. note::
  this provides a level of comfort

  warranty is most important

  written statement with respect to all facts uncovered in the due diligence state

  commitment from the seller to reimburse you: indemnity
